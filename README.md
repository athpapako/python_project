# Python Project
## Python Project for Electrical Engeeniring studies (1st Semester)
### In this project we 've created an insertion sort algorithm. This type of algorithm compares each element i of a list with the previous one i-1 and if the condition (i<i-1) is satisfied then the algorithm changes the position of the elements in the list. 
```python
print("hello world")
