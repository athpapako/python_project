# Python Project
## Python Project for Electrical Engeeniring studies (1st Semester)
## This README file will explain some important pieces in the source code
### In this project we 've created an insertion sort algorithm. This type of algorithm compares each element i of a list with the previous one i-1 and if the condition i<-i-1 is satisfied then the algorithm changes the position of the elements in the list. 
```python
def menu()
```
### This function create our main menu and takes our input for what we want to do! Depending on our answer it will run a different function.
